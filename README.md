# What is VDO.Ninja?

## What is VDO.Ninja?

In its simplest form, [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja) brings live video from a smartphone, tablet, or remote computer, directly into OBS Studio or other browser-enabled software. VDO.Ninja is offered as a free web service, but it's also available as customizable and deployable code. Some have called it the modern Swiss Army knife of audio and video transmission. ðŸ› \

The preferred support mechanism is via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vdoninja) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/feenJm8HTa), which offer community-assisted support. Discord is very active, so check it out. As well, development issues, feature requests, and bugs are tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja).&#x20;

## Bug reports

It is most helpful to report bugs via the official [GitHub](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja). While we monitor the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vdoninja) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/qWDshMsTar) channels, it is easy to miss issues/details that occur in comments and older threads.
