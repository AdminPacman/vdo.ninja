## Details

[`&automute`](and-automute-alpha.md) will auto mute the microphone of a guest when not loaded in an active OBS scene. Useful for perhaps limiting the discussion in a group chat to those on air.

`&automute=2` will mute it everywhere, while the default will still allow the director to speak to the guest, even if not in a scene.

This is a guest-side URL parameter; you may want to apply it to all guests.

Required quite a bit of code reworking; error reporting is on in the console, so please report issues. Feedback also welcomed.
