## Details

`&noisegatesettings` is used in conjunction with [`&noisegate`](../../source-settings/noisegate.md). This feature lets you tweak the noise-gate's variables, making it more or less aggressive as needed.

It takes a comma separated list:

* First value is target gain (0 to 100), although 0 to 40 is probably the recommended range here.
* Second value is the threshold value where the gate is triggered if below it. \~ 100 is loudly speaking, \~ 20 is light background noise levels, and under 5 is quiet background levels.
* Third value is how 'sticky' the gate-open position is, in milliseconds. Having this set to a few seconds should prevent someone from being cut off while speaking or if taking a short pause.
