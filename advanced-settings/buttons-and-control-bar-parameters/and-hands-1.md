# \&forcecontrols

General Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md), [`&view`](../view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../view-parameters/scene.md))

## Details

`&forcecontrols` is experimental, but it will try to keep the video controls visible, even if your mouse isn't hovering over the video.

{% hint style="info" %}
The VDO.Ninja tab/window still needs to be 'active' however, for this to work; changing focus to another tab will stop it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only works really for Chrome/Chromium on desktop; not Firefox, etc.
{% endhint %}
