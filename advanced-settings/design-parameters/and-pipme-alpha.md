# \&pipme

General Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md), [`&view`](../view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../view-parameters/scene.md))

## Aliases

* `&mypip`
* `&pip3`

## Details

`&pipme` will cause your self-video preview window to pop out into its own picture in picture (floating/draggable) on load.

This is not compatible with [`&autostart`](../../source-settings/and-autostart.md). Works with director or guest; not tested on mobile.

`CTRL + ALT + P` will also toggle the picture in picture, without needing any URL parameters. (`cmd + ALT + P` on Mac)
