# \&broadcasttransfer (alpha)

Director Option! ([`&director`](../../viewers-settings/director.md))\
**ALPHA-ONLY** - Only available at [https://vdo.ninja/alpha/](https://vdo.ninja/alpha/)

## Aliases

* `&bct`

## Details

`&broadcasttransfer` will let you specify the default for whether to transfer a guest from room to room in [broadcast mode](../view-parameters/broadcast.md) or not. Mainly useful for when using [`&rooms`](../../director-settings/rooms.md), since there isn't a transfer menu option when using it, since its more of a hotkey option.

If a director clicks "transfer", there is a checkmark to enable "covert user into broadcast mode when transferred". This URL option enables it by default. It also then is enabled by default when using the quick-transfer feature used by [`&rooms`](../../director-settings/rooms.md).
