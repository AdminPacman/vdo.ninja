## Details

`&maindirectorpassword` lets you set a pseudo 'master room password' as a director. It helps avoid getting locked out as the director, if someone else tries to claim the director-role first. ie:\
[`https://vdo.ninja/alpha/?director=ROOMNAME&maindirectorpassword=MASTERPASS`](https://vdo.ninja/alpha/?director=ROOMNAME\&maindirectorpassword=MASTERPASS)``

This will add a [`&token`](../settings-parameters/and-token-alpha.md) value to the invite/scene links.

This token is used by the guests to check a remote database server to see who currently 'owns' the token; it persists though, even if the director is not connected.

When using `&maindirectorpassword` as a director, it tells this database that you are the owner, and it will persist even if you aren't connected to VDO.Ninja. The [`&token`](../settings-parameters/and-token-alpha.md) tells the guest to ignore other logic about who the director is, instead using the info provided by the token-lookup to determine whose the director.

I may change or revoke this feature, depending on how testing goes this week, as it's rather experimental.
