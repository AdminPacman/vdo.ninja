# \&holdwithvideo

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md))

## Aliases

* `&queue4`

## Details

`&holdwithvideo` added, with the alias `&queue4`, which is just like [`&hold`](and-hold.md), except the director does see the guest's video and audio before the guest is activated. The guest can't see the director until activated, but does get a message telling them they are waiting to be activated.

This mode do not apply when you have [`&queue`](../../general-settings/queue.md) also on the director's link, however, rather just when added to the guest-invite link only.

Transferring the guest to another room will also automatically activate the guest. You don't need to press the pink 'activate' button if you just intend to transfer them and don't want to talk to the guest you are screening.
