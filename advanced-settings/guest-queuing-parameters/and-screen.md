# \&screen

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md))

## Aliases

* `&queue2`

## Details

`&screen` now replaces the way [`&queue`](../../general-settings/queue.md) worked before, where the guest can see/hear the director, but not other guests, until activated.

[`&queue`](../../general-settings/queue.md) was changed to not allow the guest to see the director's video, until the director activates the guest with their pink activate-guest button. Otherwise, it's the same as before.

`&queue2` is given the alias `&screen`, intending to imply you can use this mode to screen incoming guests by talking to them, before approving them.

This mode do not apply when you have [`&queue`](../../general-settings/queue.md) also on the director's link, however, rather just when added to the guest-invite link only.

Transferring the guest to another room will also automatically activate the guest. You don't need to press the pink 'activate' button if you just intend to transfer them and don't want to talk to the guest you are screening.
