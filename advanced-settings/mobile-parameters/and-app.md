# \&app

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md))

## Details

`&app` loads the site into an "**app mode**" and allows you to load a new URL via the website itself.

This parameter is enabled in the mobile native app's new website-mode option by default (the screen share option is also hidden).
