# \&suppresslocalaudio

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md))

## Details

`&suppresslocalaudio` will disable local audio playback of a Chrome tab while screen-sharing it. This can be used with the new [WHIP](../mixer-scene-parameters/and-whip.md) output of VDO.Ninja to publish a VDO.Ninja scene directly to Twitch, without having to deal with any audio feedback issues while having that scene tab open.

For more details on these new features see here:\

(Chrome/chromium-browsers only)
