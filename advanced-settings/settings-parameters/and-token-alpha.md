| (alphanumeric-characters only) | a token for invite/scene links to determine whose the director of a room |

## Details

When using [`&maindirectorpassword`](../director-parameters/and-maindirectorpassword-alpha.md) as a director, it will add `&token=xxx` to the invite/scene links.

This token is used by the guests to check a remote database server to see who currently 'owns' the token; it persists though, even if the director is not connected.

When using [`&maindirectorpassword`](../director-parameters/and-maindirectorpassword-alpha.md) as a director, it tells this database that you are the owner, and it will persist even if you aren't connected to VDO.Ninja. The `&token` tells the guest to ignore other logic about who the director is, instead using the info provided by the token-lookup to determine whose the director.

I may change or revoke this feature, depending on how testing goes this week, as it's rather experimental.
