## Details

`&groupview` is the same as [`&group`](../../general-settings/and-group.md), except it lets you see those groups without actually needing to join them with your mic/camera. (There's no button in the directors/guest view for this, since there isn't a need yet for that.)

You can change the view-only groups via the API (http/IFrame) or using the [Comms app](../../steves-helper-apps/comms.md), which has been updated with buttons for this option. the HTTP documentation: [https://github.com/steveseguin/Companion-Ninja/blob/main/README.md#api-commands](https://github.com/steveseguin/Companion-Ninja/blob/main/README.md#api-commands)

You can now use the HTTP/WSS API to both join and leave a group; not just toggle said state. Both the view-group function and regular group function.
