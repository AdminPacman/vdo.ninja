# \&controlroombitrate

Sender-Side Option! ([`&push`](../../source-settings/push.md))

## Aliases

* `&crb`

## Details

Allows a guest to control their total room video bitrate dynamically from the settings panel (under video settings).

A slider appears in the guestâ€™s settings menu.

This feature could be useful for guests that have limited CPU or Network bandwidth to self-regulate.

Lowering this slider will reduce the video bitrate of incoming video streams.

It will not allow the guest to increase the room bitrate's limits; only lower them.

You need to be a publisher to access this value (as the settings button is needed).

Consider using [`&totalroombitrate`](totalroombitrate.md) if you wish to increase the bitrate higher than the default max of \~ 500-kbps.
