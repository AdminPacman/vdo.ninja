# \&scale

Viewer-Side Option! ([`&view`](view.md), [`&scene`](scene.md), [`&room`](../../general-settings/room.md))

## Options

Example: `&scale=100`

| Value                             | Description                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| (integer value between 0 and 100) | scale the incoming video feed by this percentage                   |
| `100`                             | doesn't allow the incoming video feed to scale down the resolution |

## Details

Example: If the video inbound has a resolution of 1920x1080, `&scale=50` would limit the resolution to 960x540 instead.

The nice thing about this is that it doesn't matter which resolution their camera supports; the scale is software based and doesn't care about resolutions or aspect ratios.

This can help a viewer reduce frame stuttering, CPU load, and improve frame rates, without having to have the guest rejoin the stream.

Requires the publisher of the stream to support dynamic scaling; Firefox and Chrome should be supported.

There is a toggle in the director's room to add `&scale=100` to the scene URL:\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)
