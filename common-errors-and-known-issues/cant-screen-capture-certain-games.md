# Can't screen capture certain games

If you're struggling to capture a game with VDO.Ninja using the browser, a list of options are below.

* Disable Fullscreen Optimizations: Right-click the game's .exe file, go to Properties > Compatibility, and check "Disable fullscreen optimizations"
  * Sometimes you want to even uncheck "Disable fullscreen optimizations", so try both ways
  * Restart the game after applying changes.\

* Run as Administrator: Try running both the game and your capture software as administrator.\

* Compatibility Mode: Run the game in compatibility mode for an earlier version of Windows.\

* Run the game in windowed or borderless windowed mode\

* Consider using OBS Studio to capture the game with, and then output the captured video to VDO.Ninja using the OBS Virtual Camera.
  * Sound can be captured with a virtual audio device in conjunction with the the OBS audio monitoring output option.\

* If using hybrid graphics, such as two graphics cards, try to run the game on the same graphics card as the system / browser.\

* Try window capture or full-screen capture, or try with a different browser.
  * If using Window capture, you can capture the game's audio with the use of a virtual audio device, like Voicemeeter.
  * Display capture tends to offer better frame rates than window capture\

* Use an HDMI splitter and an HDMI to USB adapter to capture the output sent to your monitor.\

* Update your graphics card drivers\

* If using a browser such as Opera GX, it may throttle or disable VDO.Ninja when gaming.
  * The Electron Capture application, or a different browser, are better choices
