# Can't select a camera lens on mobile

Some camera lenses are not easily accessible in native mobile applications, and many are not available at all in the browser.

The [native app versions](../steves-helper-apps/native-mobile-app-versions.md) of VDO.Ninja may sometimes offer additional lens options not found in the browser, but adding all options is still a work-in-progress.

On Android, you can try Firefox Mobile as well as Chrome or other browsers to see if your camera lens appears there.

There is the option to digitally zoom with VDO.Ninja, [\&effects=7](../source-settings/effects.md), will allow you to adjust the digital zoom via the browser. This isn't an ideal solution, but it may work in some cases where optical zoom isn't available.

### WHIP mode

VDO.Ninja supports the [WHIP](../advanced-settings/mixer-scene-parameters/and-whip-alpha.md) streaming protocol, so if there is a native camera app that has proper WHIP-output support, and has the camera features you are looking for, using that can be used with VDO.Ninja.

Currently WHIP support in VDO.Ninja is a bit experimental, but the publishing URL for a WHIP-enabled device to stream to is:

_`https://whip.vdo.ninja/STREAMIDHERE`_

To view a WHIP stream then on VDO.Ninja, have open the following link in your browser:

_`https://vdo.ninja/alpha/?whip=STREAMIDHERE`_

### Lens adapter

There are camera lens adapters available for smartphones for fairly cheap; anywhere from $3 on aliexpress to $20 on Amazon. While not the best solution, it may be a solution available in a pinch that works across all mobile applications and services.
