# Cursor shows trailing or artifacting

If using Chrome, launch Chrome from command line using the flag:&#x20;

`--enable-features=AllowWgcDesktopCapturer`

There is an issue in some versions of Chrome where the mouse cursor can cause visual issues while screen sharing.\
\
Another option is to use a different browser; Firefox is a safe alternative if the issue is specific to Chrome.  Browsers like Edge and Opera also use Chromium, so likely you will see the same issue across Chrome, Edge, and Opera, while Firefox does not use Chromium. You might lose some audio support options when using Firefox however.



If the issue is just that the cursor shows while screen sharing, see:\
