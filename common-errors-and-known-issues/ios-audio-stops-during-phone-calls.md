# iOS audio stops during phone calls

With using iOS devices (iPhones or iPads) , you may occasionally experience an issue where your microphone stops working. This typically occurs when there's an incoming call, text message, or other system notification on your device. Unfortunately, this is a known limitation with iOS devices imposed by Apple.

### Available Solutions

If you encounter this audio issue during a conference, here are some ways to resolve it:

1. **Mute and Unmute**: The simplest fix is to tap the mute button, then unmute yourself. This action reconnects your microphone and should restore your audio.
2. **Refresh from Control Room**: If you're still having issues, ask the room's director to refresh your audio. They can do this from their control panel.
3. **Rejoin the Conference**: If the above methods don't work, try leaving the conference completely and rejoining. This will re-establish all your media connections.
4. **Enable Do Not Disturb**: To prevent this issue, consider enabling Do Not Disturb mode on your iOS device before joining the conference. This will block incoming calls and notifications that might interrupt your audio.
5. **Use a Different Device**: If possible, consider joining from a non-iOS device, such as a desktop computer or Android device, which don't experience this particular issue.

Remember, if your audio cuts out, don't panic! Try these solutions, and you should be back to participating in no time. If problems persist, please join the [Discord ](https://discord.vdo.ninja)for further assistance.
