# Loading circle shows in OBS or browser

The loading circle will appear in a VDO.Ninja view link if a video does not auto-load within several seconds or so.\
\
It will be removed once the video connects, and won't re-appear unless the browser source/page is refreshed.\
\
You can hide this loading circle by default by adding `&cleanoutput` to the URL of the view link.  this will hide other non-essentially UI elements as well, such as any error messages.  In most cases, when a view link is loaded into OBS, most non-essentially elements are hidde by default.
