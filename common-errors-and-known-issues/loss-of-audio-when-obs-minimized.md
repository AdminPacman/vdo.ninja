# Loss of audio when OBS minimized

Some users have reported their audio recording of VDO.Ninja stops or becomes choppy once OBS Studio is taken out of focus or minimized.\
\
One solution is to run OBS Studio in Administrator mode.  You can do this by first ensuring OBS is closed, and then holding SHIFT, right-click the OBS Studio icon; select `Run as administrator` from the menu that appears.\
\
Another option is to use the [electron-capture.md](../steves-helper-apps/electron-capture.md "mention") to capture VDO.Ninja, instead of OBS browser source. &#x20;
