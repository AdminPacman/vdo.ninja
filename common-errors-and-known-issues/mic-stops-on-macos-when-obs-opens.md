# Mic stops on macOS when OBS opens

If the microphone stops working in VDO.Ninja when OBS Studio is open, on macOS, considering using Safari instead of Chrome or other browser.\
\
One user with this issue noted the problem resolved itself when they used Safari instead of Chrome.\
\
Some users on Google noted that they re-selected their microphone permissions in the browser to resolve the issue as well, so there may be some system-level permissions issue at play here.\
\
It's perhaps possible a virtual audio cable might also help, if the issue is a shared device issue. Using the monitor audio output of OBS as an input to the virtual audio cable, or using an application like Loopback for macOS, might be a way to bypass the issue.
