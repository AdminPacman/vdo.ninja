# Very old iPhone support

An iPhone 6S or newer is needed for [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/), as Apple's webKit lacks the required webRTC support and   iPhone 3g, 4, 4s, 5, and iPhone 6 are not supported as a result, and many older iPads are also not supported.

I think a minimum of iOS 13 is required, but I'd go further and say I'd strongly recommend at least iOS 16 be used, as older versions have serious limitations and bugs. Apple has come a long way with iOS 16 and 17 (as of this writing), so keep your iOS version up to date is recommended.\

Older Android phones tend to work usually though, as I think Google added support for webRTC earlier on than Apple did, but you might be limited in terms of maximum quality or face heat issues on such older phones.
