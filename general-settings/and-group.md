description: Puts guests into sub-groups, so they only see others in the same group
---

# \&group

General Option! ([`&push`](../source-settings/push.md), [`&room`](room.md), [`&view`](../advanced-settings/view-parameters/view.md), [`&scene`](../advanced-settings/view-parameters/scene.md))

## Aliases

* `&groups`

## Options

Example: `&group=Groupname`

<table><thead><tr><th width="222.57142857142856">Value</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>1</code></td><td>adds the guest or director to group 1</td></tr><tr><td><code>2</code></td><td>adds the guest or director to group 2</td></tr><tr><td><code>3,4,5,6</code></td><td>adds the guest or director to group 3, 4, 5 and 6</td></tr><tr><td>(string)</td><td>creates/adds the guest or director to a custom group</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Details

The idea is, you can put guests of a room into sub-groups. When added to a sub group, those guests will only be able to see and hear others in that same sub group.&#x20;

Guests can be assigned to multiple subgroups. Groups can be specified via the URL using `&group=1,5,6` or/and the director can dynamically assign sub-groups, as seen in the below image.&#x20;

If not in a group, that guest will still see/hear everyone, regardless of which group they are in, even if a guest in another group may not be able to see/hear that guest back.

Scenes can be put into groups as well, via the URL group option, such `&group=3`, but the director will not be able to dynamically change which group a scene is in. Not yet at least.

Using this group function is an alternative to transfer rooms, however it's perhaps less secure, as a guest could just tinker with their URL parameters or just refresh their page to perhaps see everyone in the room again.

[`&groupaudio`](and-groupaudio.md) can be used to enable audio in-between different groups, instead of audio being group-specific. Useful for blind-dating show formats or such.

### New in Version 22

Custom groups used by remote guests now show in the director's view, just like custom scenes do. If you use `&groups=group,test,vdo`, new group buttons will appear.\

With [`&groupmode`](../advanced-settings/setup-parameters/and-groupmode.md) added to your URL, when not assigned to a group, you don't hear or see anything. This also goes for remote participants who are not in a group - you will not see or hear them if they are not in a group, even if you also are not in a group.
