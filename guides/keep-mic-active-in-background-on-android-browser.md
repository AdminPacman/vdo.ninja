# Keep Mic Active in Background on Android Browser

This guide will show you how to keep your microphone active for VDO.Ninja even when your Android browser is running in the background. This is particularly useful for audio-only applications where you need to multitask while continuing to use the microphone.

### Prerequisites

* An Android device (tested on Galaxy Z Fold 6 with the latest Android version)
* A browser with VDO.Ninja open and running

### Steps

1. Open your Android home screen.
2. Tap the vertical hamburger menu (three vertical lines) at the bottom of the screen.
   * This will display small versions of your recently used apps.
3. Swipe left or right to find your browser app where VDO.Ninja is running.
4. Locate the browser app icon at the top middle of the app preview.
5. Tap on the browser app icon.
   * A menu with 5 options will appear.
6. Choose "Keep open" from the menu.
   * You should see a lock icon appear on the bottom right of the app preview.
7. Your browser will now stay running in the background.
8. Open VDO.Ninja in your browser if you haven't already.
9. Start your VDO.Ninja session as usual.
10. You can now switch to other apps, and the microphone will remain active for VDO.Ninja.

### Verifying Microphone Activity

* Look for a green dot at the top right edge of your screen, next to the battery icon.
* This green dot indicates that your microphone is active and listening.

### Important Notes

* This setting survives device reboots, but you'll need to press the start button on VDO.Ninja to reactivate the connection after a reboot.
* The "Keep open" setting will remain active for your browser until you manually turn it off.
* This method is equivalent to setting the mic to "allow always," which is no longer available due to security concerns.

### Compatibility

This method has been tested on a Galaxy Z Fold 6 with the most current version of Android. Results may vary on other devices or Android versions

### Additional notes for Users

* **Troubleshooting**: If you experience issues with the microphone cutting out:
  * Ensure your browser app and Android OS is up to date
  * Check if any power-saving modes are interfering with the background process
  * Try clearing the browser cache and restarting the app
* **App Permissions**: Regularly check your browser's app permissions to ensure microphone access hasn't been revoked by system updates or other changes.
* **Alternative Browsers**: If you're having trouble with your default browser, try using a different one. Some users report better results with specific browsers like Chrome or Firefox.
* **Notification Importance**: Consider setting your browser app's notifications to "High" importance in your Android settings. This may help prevent the system from closing the app in low-memory situations.
* **Native app alternative:** If you can't get it working with the browser, there is the [native app version](../steves-helper-apps/native-mobile-app-versions.md) of VDO.Ninja that you can try using instead. It's basic, but it should support background usage.
