# How to use the green screen just locally

Since OBS is using a very old browser inside, the green screen effect inside [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) wouldn't really run well within OBS itself, and even if it did, accessing the camera from a browser-source is a hassle to setup.

&#x20;What you could do though is use the Electron Capture app, and then just window capture the local preview output. You can hide the interface UI and access any camera/microphone changes via the Electron Capture's right-click context menu of options instead.

Getting this working is not complex; pretty easy once you do it once actually. Sample URL to enter into VDO.Ninja:
