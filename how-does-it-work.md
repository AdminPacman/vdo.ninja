# How does it work

VDO.Ninja harnesses the power of WebRTC, a technology that enables secure, real-time communication directly between web browsers. This peer-to-peer approach means most of the action happens right within your browser, ensuring low latency and high-quality video transmission. While VDO.Ninja does utilize servers for initial setup, the actual video data flows directly between devices, leading to a remarkably smooth experience.

**Benefits of the Peer-to-Peer Approach**

* **Ultra-Low Latency:** Experience minimal delays, making interactions feel natural and conversations flow seamlessly.
* **Exceptional Video Quality:** Enjoy crisp, clear video, even at high resolutions.
* **Bandwidth Efficiency:** When on the same local network, video data stays local, saving you precious bandwidth.
* **OBS Integration:** Stream directly into OBS or other browser-enabled applications without any extra software or accounts.
* **Versatility:** VDO.Ninja works across a wide range of devices and platforms, from your smartphone to a Tesla!

**Simple and Powerful**

VDO.Ninja's core functionality revolves around two types of URLs:

* **PUSH URL:** This is used on the sending device (your smartphone, webcam, etc.) to capture and transmit the video and audio.
* **VIEW URL:** Open this URL on any device, anywhere, to watch the live stream in a clean, full-screen interface.

**Collaboration Made Easy**

Beyond basic streaming, VDO.Ninja offers group chat rooms, giving you more control and flexibility when working with multiple streams simultaneously. You can manage participants, adjust settings, and even create custom layouts, all within your browser.

**URL Parameters: Your Control Center**

VDO.Ninja uses URL parameters to fine-tune your streaming experience. These parameters act like commands, allowing you to adjust video quality, enable features, and much more. Think of them as similar to command-line options you might use with software like FFmpeg.
