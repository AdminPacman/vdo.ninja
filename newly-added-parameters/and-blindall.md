# \&blindall

Director Option! ([`&director`](../viewers-settings/director.md))

## Details

`&blindall` is a director's URL parameter. It allows the director 'blinding' all the guests at a time (new button appears to toggle it). Guests that refresh will be auto blinded based on the state of the button; compatible with co-directors.
