# Other Parameters

There are some more parameters on [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) which are currently not ready for production, not intended to be used, or not well-documented.

You could find out more about these parameters when searching for them on this link:\

| `&showheader`        | Forces the header bar to show even if using [`&cleanoutput`](advanced-settings/design-parameters/cleanoutput.md) for example                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The default value is balanced.                                                                                                                                              |

| `&micsamplerate`     | Lets you specify the capture audio sample rate. Also added purely for experimental reasons; I don't recommend touching.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
