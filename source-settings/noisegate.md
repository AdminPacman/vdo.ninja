## Details

The default setting is OFF. You can switch on the noise gate in the audio settings:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (95).png>)

This is a new noise gate, that lowers your mic volume to 10% of its current value based on volume-level activity. If you haven't made a significant sound in few seconds, the noise gate kicks in, and will re-enable when a significant noise is detected. It will take about 300-ms for the volume to recover once the noise triggers it back on, which can be a small bit harsh/distracting at times.

The point of this feature is to allow guests who might be in a rather noisy room or who are unable to use echo cancellation to still engage with a chat, without them introducing feedback back into the room.

This is a very hard and aggressive noise filter, and a guest won't be audible to others in the room if others in the room are currently talking.

User feedback on this feature welcomed.

### Noise Gate Settings

[`&noisegatesettings`](../advanced-settings/audio-parameters/and-noisegatesettings.md) is used in conjunction with `&noisegate`. This feature lets you tweak the noise-gate's variables, making it more or less aggressive as needed.

It takes a comma separated list:

* First value is target gain (0 to 100), although 0 to 40 is probably the recommended range here.
* Second value is the threshold value where the gate is triggered if below it. \~ 100 is loudly speaking, \~ 20 is light background noise levels, and under 5 is quiet background levels.
* Third value is how 'sticky' the gate-open position is, in milliseconds. Having this set to a few seconds should prevent someone from being cut off while speaking or if taking a short pause.
