# LUT maker for color calibration

Using accurate color samples obtained from the local paint shop (free) or a color checker card from Datacolor/Aliexpress, you can create online a color filter (LUT) for the purpose of color correcting video recordings, photos, and OBS live streams.\
\
This tool can create custom LUTS (PNG or 3D CUBE) on demand; you just need color references cards to get started. OBS Studio supports PNG-based LUTS, giving everyone the taste of pro-level color grading for free.\
\
It's also open-source and no downloads are needed; you can run the script using Google Colab online. A video guide is available to walk you thru out to customize it, plus the code can be easily adjusted to meet your own needs or preferences.\
