{% endembed %}

Consolidate your live social messaging streams, including YouTube, Twitch, and more, into a single chat stream that can be docked into OBS and be used to to select featured chat messages as an overlay.

Very much like Chat Overlay Ninja, except is purely for live chat and has a focus on consolidation of chat messages, instead of just featured chat. Has many features and supported sites at this point.

Get support on the Discord if you have any problems: [ðŸ’¬â”‚chatâ€¤overlay-support](https://discord.gg/6Wbu848w94)
