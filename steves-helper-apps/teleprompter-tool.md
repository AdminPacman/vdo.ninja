Created a tool that lets you rotate, flip, and mirror any cors-compatible website. It's designed mainly for teleprompters.

* There are drop downs to switch between source modes, rotation, transformation
* It will store the last used settings automatically, and restore automatically on reload. simple
* Passing discord or chat pop out links will be auto-converted into a cors-friendly embed version of the chat pop out
* (optionally) it can take `&link` with a URL value, or `&twitch` to pass a user name
* Hide menu button; to show the menu again, just reload the page

This works great for reading chat out from a teleprompter or even just for VDO.Ninja feeds. VDO.Ninja works great for sending remote teleprompter feeds to something like a Firestick 4K Max, and this teleprompting website should make it easy to flip/invert/mirror the video as needed.
