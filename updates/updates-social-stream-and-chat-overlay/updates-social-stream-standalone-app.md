**v0.1.4**\
It's still very much in "just a preview test" mode, though I've trying to work thru all the issues. Please bare with me if you have issues with it.

* Fixed a bug that broke 0.1.3
* The auto-YouTube Chat activation option will only work if the video is LIVE and PUBLIC. If unlisted, you may need to enable YouTube cat pop-out manually.
* I've had some users report the ZIP is detected as a virus. I'm pretty sure it's a false positive as VirusTotal does not detect anything. Still, feel free to use the extension version instead, as that contains no executables.

I'm putting out a "still-in-development preview" version of the **Social Stream Standalone App**

* I've been poking at this project for the past year, and due to frequent requests for it I'm making it available as a preview-build.
* I'd say 90% of the features available in the extension work in this standalone version, with the interface about 50% done.
* Available as an installer for Windows x64 only at this point, but a Mac build is probably not far off.
