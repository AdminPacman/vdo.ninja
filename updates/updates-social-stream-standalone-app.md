# Updates - Social Stream Standalone App

#### November 10

* Also updated the Social Stream Standalone App; [https://github.com/steveseguin/social\_stream/releases/tag/0.1.4](https://github.com/steveseguin/social\_stream/releases/tag/0.1.4) (mac/win64)\
  \-- It's still very much in 'just a preview test" mode, though I've trying to work thru all the issues. Please bare with me if you have issues with it.

#### **October 26**

* MacOS support added to the Standalone version of Social Stream
* Several bugs fixed in the standalone version\

#### **October 22**

* I'm putting out a "still-in-development preview" version of the **Social Stream Standalone App**\
  \
  **--** I've been poking at this project for the past year, and due to frequent requests for it I'm making it available as a preview-build.\
  \-- I'd say 90% of the features available in the extension work in this standalone version, with the interface about 50% done.\
  \-- Available as an installer for Windows x64 only at this point, but a Mac build is probably not far off.\
